If you try to randomize and the characthers needed are still in the matrix.
Point them out by red color to let the user know it was possible to complete.
(This proves to be quite difficult and may be saved for later)

Come up with a reason to punish the user if you randomize when still able to complete

Give an encouraging message if you find the word and write it correctly

Give points in some form of system based on length of the word perhaps?

Add a button that you can click to randomize the words
